# Recipe-1
A recipe-finding app that takes your ingredients and determines a meal for you! Takes your meals for the week and shows your daily calorie intake. Built using Swift.

# Motivation

Many times, I find myself peering into the fridge unable to know what to make. By making this app, I'll have easy access to recipes soley based on my supplies.
I also love to keep track of my calories for the week, so it will help to also visualize what days I'm eating more than others and to stick to a schedule.

# Technologies Used

Swift, KingFischer, Charts
